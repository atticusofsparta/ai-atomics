# AI classified atomic assets

This application uses the tensorflow mobilenet image classification model to generate tags for Arweave atomic assets.

The assets are images tagged with the intention of being listed on the bazar.arweave.dev marketplace!

To deploy these assets an arweave wallet with AR is required, and thats it!

Thanks to the team at community labs for a great SDK - arweave-wallet-kit is easy to use and pretty to look at :D
